# Atomic Habits — Distilled Principles

Extracted from *Atomic Habits* by James Clear and the Tim Ferriss podcast interview.

## Core Philosophy

**"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."**

Goals are about the results you want. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. Winners and losers often have the same goals — what separates them is the system.

## The Four Laws of Behavior Change

### Building Good Habits

| Law | Strategy |
|-----|----------|
| **1. Make it obvious** | Design your environment. Put cues in plain sight. |
| **2. Make it attractive** | Bundle with things you enjoy. Join tribes where the behavior is normal. |
| **3. Make it easy** | Reduce friction. Use the 2-minute rule. Prime your environment. |
| **4. Make it satisfying** | Use immediate rewards. Track your progress. Never miss twice. |

### Breaking Bad Habits (Inversion)

| Law | Strategy |
|-----|----------|
| **1. Make it invisible** | Remove cues. Redesign your environment. |
| **2. Make it unattractive** | Reframe the mindset. Highlight the benefits of avoiding. |
| **3. Make it difficult** | Increase friction. Use commitment devices (Kitchen Safe, etc.). |
| **4. Make it unsatisfying** | Add accountability. Make the costs public. |

## Identity-Based Habits

**The most effective way to change behavior is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.**

Three layers of behavior change:
1. **Outcomes** — what you get (losing weight, publishing a book)
2. **Processes** — what you do (running, writing daily)
3. **Identity** — what you believe (I am a runner, I am a writer)

**"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."**

Formula:
1. Decide the type of person you want to be
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins

Example statements:
- "I'm the type of person who doesn't miss workouts"
- "I'm the type of person who shows up on time"
- "I'm the type of person who finishes what they start"

Alternative: Carry a question — "What would a healthy person do?"

## The 2-Minute Rule

**Scale down any habit to something that takes 2 minutes or less.**

- "Read 30 books a year" → "Read one page"
- "Meditate 30 minutes daily" → "Meditate for 60 seconds"
- "Run 5K" → "Put on running shoes"

**A habit must be established before it can be improved.**

Master the art of showing up. Consistency > intensity.

---

## Never Miss Twice

Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.

**"The bad days matter more than the good days."** If you show up on the bad days, even if it's less than you hoped for, you maintain the habit. And if you maintain the habit, all you need is time.

**Reduce the scope, stick to the schedule.**
- Don't have 45 minutes? Do 15.
- Can't do a full workout? Do a few sets of squats.
- Something > nothing.

---

## Environment Design

**"You don't have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it."**

Questions to ask:
- What behaviors are obvious in this room?
- What is this space designed to encourage?
- How can I make the good habit the path of least resistance?

Examples:
- Leave workout clothes out the night before
- Put phone in another room until lunch
- Move beer to the back of the lowest fridge shelf
- Build a home gym (reduce friction to zero)

**"If you can get 1% better each day for one year, you'll end up 37 times better by the time you're done."**

---

## Habit Stacking

**Link a new habit to an existing one.**

Formula: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."

Examples:
- After I pour my morning coffee, I will meditate for one minute.
- After I sit down for dinner, I will say one thing I'm grateful for.
- After I put on my workout clothes, I will immediately leave for the gym.

## Keystone Habits (Upstream Habits)

Some habits are upstream from other good behaviors. Find the **lead domino**.

Ask: "When I'm living a good day, what are the key habits that are part of that?"

Exercise is a common keystone:
- Leads to better eating ("I don't want to waste the workout")
- Leads to better sleep (tired from training)
- Leads to better focus (post-workout high)
- Leads to better mood

**"Rather than worrying about every little domino, what's the first action that's upstream from the other productive things?"**

---

## Social Environment

**"Join groups where your desired behavior is the normal behavior."**

We absorb the habits of the tribes we belong to:
- CrossFitters start eating paleo
- Writers who join writing groups write more
- People who join running clubs become runners

**"If you have to choose between habits you don't love but fitting in, versus habits you want but being ostracized, the desire to belong will usually win."**

The solution: Surround yourself with people where your desired behavior IS the normal behavior.

---

## Pre-Game Rituals

**Develop a consistent sequence that triggers the desired state.**

Examples:
- Writer: Same desk, headphones, same playlist → writing mode
- Athlete: Same warm-up routine → competition mode
- Josh Waitzkin: Compressed his ritual to 30 seconds

The sequence itself triggers the behavior. The music isn't even necessary after it becomes automatic.

---

## Tracking and Measurement

**"What gets measured gets managed."**

Track:
- Workouts in a journal
- Nights away from home (via calendar)
- Key metrics weekly

But don't over-measure. Some things just need: Did I do it? Yes/No.

## Questions for Annual Review

From James Clear's reflection practice:

1. **What am I optimizing for?** (Changes over time — money, time, creative output, freedom)
2. **Does this activity fill me with energy or drain me of energy?**
3. **Does the attention I'm giving this match its true importance?**
4. **Can my current habits carry me to my desired future?**
5. **How can I create an environment that will naturally bring about my desired change?**
6. **If someone could only see my actions and not hear my words, what would they say are my priorities?**
7. **What game am I playing? Is it worth winning?**
8. **What is the work that keeps working for me once it's done?**

## The Compound Effect

**"Time magnifies whatever you feed it."**

- Good habits: time becomes your ally
- Bad habits: time becomes your enemy

Small improvements compound:
- 1% better every day for a year = 37x better
- 1% worse every day for a year = nearly zero

**"The trajectory of your life bends in the direction of your habits."**

## Practical Tactics

### Breaking Bad Habits
- **Substitution** often works better than elimination (sparkling water instead of soda)
- **Increase friction** — put it out of sight, out of reach
- **Kitchen Safe** — timed lockbox for temptations
- Ask: "What need is this habit solving? Is there a better solution?"

### Building Good Habits
- **Reduce friction** — home gym beats driving to gym
- **Prime the environment** — set up everything the night before
- **Bundle temptations** — only listen to favorite podcast while exercising
- **Public commitment** — tell people, create accountability

### For Procrastination
- Notice tasks mentioned 3+ times → something's blocking you
- Ask: "What would this look like if it were easy?"
- Often the issue is the habit isn't attractive enough — find a version you actually want to do

## Application for Mirage

When processing tasks, apply these filters:

1. **Identity alignment** — Does this task connect to who the user wants to become?
2. **Keystone check** — Is this upstream from other important behaviors?
3. **2-minute test** — Can this be done in 2 minutes? Flag as `[DO IT]`
4. **Never miss twice** — If skipped yesterday, it's priority today
5. **Friction analysis** — What's making this hard? How to reduce friction?
6. **Environment question** — What setup would make this automatic?
7. **Compound potential** — Does this small action build over time? `[COMPOUNDS]`
